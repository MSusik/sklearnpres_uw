    "    the data `X` (e.g. `model.fit(X)`).\n",

    "    This method accepts one argument, the new data `X_new` (e.g. `model.predict(X_new)`),\n",
    "    and returns the learned label for each object in the array.\n",
    "  + `model.predict_proba()` : For classification problems, some estimators also provide\n",
    "    this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label.\n",
    "    In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by `model.predict()`.\n",
    "  + `model.score()` : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement\n",
    "    a score method.  Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n",
    "- Available in **unsupervised estimators**\n",
